PER:
	For Centre and basic... compare new_dqn with new_dqn_with_per

With Context:
	For Center and basic... compare drqn with LSTM, simple_RNN and GRU

Normal Transfer Learning:
	1) Compare Train_from_scratch on basic with Load_from_centre directly on basic
	2) Add in, Load_from_centre-fine_tune_last and then run on basic

Incrermental Transfer Learning:
	1) Load_center-Train_basic on less_actions_deathmatch (need comparison here?)
	2) Add in, Fine_tune_with_more_actions
